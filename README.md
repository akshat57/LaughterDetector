# LaughterDetector
This is an ongoing project right now on laughter detection

The current stage of the project is a literature survey which I completed sometime back. I am now focusing on implementing the different algorithms in laughter detection. The data set being used is the 'SSPNet Vocalization Corpus' (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/vincia/?p=378). I will slowly shift to the AudioSet by google. 

The relevant papers are in the folder called 'papers', which contains a chronological numbering of most of the work done in laughter detection, starting as back far as 2003, to very recent papers in 2019. I do not claim that this literature survey is exhaustive but I have tried it to incorporate as much work done on the topic as possible. In one place. Papers are grouped together in folders if they are related by topic or authors. Sometimes important references to the paper are also in the folder.

The 'data' folder contains segmented data from the 'SSPNet Vocalization Corpus' which are used in the current version of my code. There is also a  code in the folder that does this segmentation. 

The codes I have written as of yet are also given.
